# Quasmo 🧠⚛️  
*A futuristic programming language for the AI-native + Quantum world*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Quasmo** is a speculative programming language designed for the next century, where artificial intelligence and quantum computation are the backbone of every system. Quasmo is built not just for humans—but for co-creation between humans and AIs. It’s natural, safe, and abstracted from hardware.

## 🌐 Why Quasmo?

As computation evolves, traditional languages hit limits in:
- **Scalability** across quantum, neuromorphic, and distributed systems.
- **Collaboration** between AI agents and human logic.
- **Security & verification** in autonomous decision-making.

Quasmo solves this with:
- Prompt-native syntax
- Quantum-safe function structures
- Memory-safe parallelism
- Contextual AI-assisted programming

## 🔬 Core Features

- **Natural Language Integration**  
  Write and describe logic in English, auto-compiled into secure functions.
  
- **Quantum-Aware Constructs**  
  Use `qlet`, `qif`, and entanglement-safe operators.

- **AI-Generated Subroutines**  
  Offload complex logic to internal AI agents with `@think` directives.

- **Memory & Time Safe by Design**  
  Influenced by Rust and Move, verified before runtime.

- **Domain Shifting**  
  Modules adapt based on environment (cloud, edge, quantum processor, etc.).

## 🧪 Example (Human-AI Hybrid Syntax)

```quasmo
// Define a quantum-safe encryption
@think("generate post-quantum AES wrapper")
secureEncrypt(data, key) -> encryptedData

// Entangled condition execution
qif (isEntangled(key, data)) {
    qlet recovery = measure(data)
}
